# Agenda

<b>For you</b>:<br>
We would love to tell you about some of the tools we
have developed for doing behavioral science research on AMT.

<hr>
<b>For us</b>:<br>
We would like to learn more about AMT from your perspective:  

 - is research a major income stream for AMT?  

 - is AMT likely to be around for a long time?  
 
 - are there plans or ideas for how research implication of AMT could
be improved/extended?

early experimental approaches to the study of behavior
which are familiar to most people might involve studies of
basic learning phenomena in animals such as pigeons or dogs

which was later replaced with studies of learning or
thinking that were done with subjects in a lab using
pen and paper or through structured interviews and
observations of behavior in the context of some task.

which today might looks something like this, where
a subject interacts with information presented on
a computer display, where scientists might control
aspect of the information presented and record
behavioral responses using a keyboard or mouse along
with eye fixation data, reaction time, or even
neural correlates like EEG and fMRI.

What has remained relatively unchanged across all these
subsequent versions is the overall context in which the
research takes place: namely laboratories on college campuses,
and in the case of human research, the population which is
tested is most often college aged undergraduates.

# What's next?
## &nbsp;


???

the central topic my talk to day is basically to
ask, what's next?  What will -- particular experimental
as opposed to observational -- psychological research look 
like in coming years?

## .blue[The Internet as Psychology Lab]

???

And what I believe is becoming somewhat clear is that
the answer will be is some variant on the title of my
talk, that is The Internet at Psychology Lab.

The goal of my work in this area
has been to try to explore the boundaries of what 
research might look like, as well as to help enable
these advances through software engineering projects
and tool building.

# Research and Amazon Mechanical Turk 

- Turk is having a *huge* impact on academic research in behavioral sciences
- In last 5 years the dominant research paradigm of testing undergrads in the lab has been replaced with AMT samples
- Enables larger samples sizes, aid in "replication crisis" in Psychology

# Architecture

- **Command line tool** (this is the "player")
  - Allows you run experiments from a computer of your choosing
  - Allows you to interact with AMT to pay people, assign bonuses

- **psiturk.org Cloud-based services** 
  - provides secure hosting (Ad Server)
  - experiment exchange (system for sharing experiments between researchers)

# Key Advantages 

- Open source code base
- Exchangeable experiments (helps students learn, helps replicability)
- Enables complex designs that offload computation onto server rather than client

# Future directions for psiTurk

- Enabling other recruitment gateways beside Mechanical Turk
(e.g., lab-based studies, studies using mobile devices)
- Providing API hooks that enable researchers to query a potential
worker and see if they may have been exposed to a similar manipulation
in a previous psiTurk task
- Cloud-based hosting of experiments
- Exposing the command line elements as a python API which would
enable adaptive experiment designs
- Multi-player, multi-participant experiments
